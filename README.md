# surfs_up
## overview of the surfs up data analysis 
The purpose of this analysis is to analyze the temperature statistics in the month of June and December. This information will help determine the sustainability of running a surf shop in those months respectively. The analysis will be performed using the SQLite libraries in Jupyter notebook. 
## results 
### 3 key differences in weather between June and December 
The three key differences between June and December are that the average temperature was only different by about 3 degrees. However the range of temperature change was greater in December than in June. In December, the lowest temperature recorded was 56F and the highest was 83F. While in June the range was from 64F to 85F. Aside from the temperature, there are more data points recorded for June (1700) than December (1517).

## summary

From the analysis, we cannot be conclusive whether running a surf shop in December will be worthwhile. It seems like there will be a greater range of temperature in December than June but this data set simply only accounts for the temperature and not weather conditions. Additional queries and analsis will need to be performed to conclusively determine if there will be weather conditions in December or June that will hinder business.
